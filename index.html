            <p>Elden Ring receives <strong>universal appraisal</strong> from both journalists and the public.
            The well crafted world along with a refined combat system with a huge variety of character building
            is very well received. However there has always been a voice bashing Elden Ring for not providing a easy mode.
            The voice has been insisting that an easy mode is necessary for Elden Ring to be enjoyed by a wider audience,
            even though it has sold over 10 million copies just in three weeks, making it one of the most popular games nowadays.</p>

        <h2>Why I don't think Elden Ring needs an Easy Mode</h2> 
        <p><img src="download2.jpg" alt="Elden Ring Title"></p>
        <article class="blog-post">
            <p>As an aspiring game developer and game design student, I can't think of a way of implementing
            easy mode in Elden Ring. The difficulty in Souls games are all well articulated, and can be think of
            as a puzzle-like mechanic. The player is presented with a problem, and is required to come up with a
            corresponding solution. But differing from a real puzzle game, a Souls game adds more elements onto the
            equation, like the player's reaction time, and their familiarity of the mechanics, etc, but the core
            doesn't change. So if I ask you to add an easy mode to any given puzzle game, how would you do it, without
            basically remaking the game into an easier version?</p>
