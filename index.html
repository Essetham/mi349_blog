    <p>Elden Ring is an Action Rpg developed and published by <em>From Software</em> in February 2022. 
    It's the spiritual successor of the Dark Souls series made by the same company.
    The game includes new features like open world, jumping, horse riding and horse combat, 
    and features 3 times the scale of any previous Souls title.</p>
    <p>Elden Ring receives <strong>universal appraisal</strong> from both journalists and the public.
    The well crafted world along with a refined combat system with a huge variety of character building
    is very well received. However there has always been a voice bashing Elden Ring for not providing a easy mode.
    The voice has been insisting that an easy mode is necessary for Elden Ring to be enjoyed by a wider audience,
    even though it has sold over 10 million copies just in three weeks, making it one of the most popular game nowadays.</p>
